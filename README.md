# [Keep Reading! It's The Best Form Of Entertainment!](https://github.com/xlpiao/reading/blob/master/books.csv)

I started reading on Kindle in Jan 2021. No matter how busy I get, I read every day and (at least) one book per month. Reading gives me so many benefits that I've never experienced before. For me, I have to say, if the workout is an exercise for my body, then reading is an exercise for my brain. According to neuroscience research, it indicates that reading can literally change the brain. Using MRI scans, researchers have confirmed that reading activates different parts of the brain, involves a complex brain network and makes the network gets connected stronger.

Here are something I've experienced from reading so far:

1. Become More Open-Minded 
2. Help Alleviate Depression Symptoms
3. Bring Tranquility
4. Reduce Stress
5. Improve Sleeping
6. Maintain a Positive Attitude
7. Take Responsibility
8. Improve Communication Skills
9. Become More Grateful and Understanding
10. Show Respect And Love For All Living Things
11. Reshape Personal Attitude Toward Life

# [Keep Reading. It's The Best Form Of Entertainment.](https://github.com/xlpiao/reading/blob/master/books.csv)

I started reading on Kindle in Jan 2021. No matter how busy I get, I read every day and (at least) one book per month. Reading gives me so many benefits that I've never experienced before. For me, I have to say, if the workout is an exercise for my body, then reading is an exercise for my brain. According to neuroscience research, it indicates that reading can literally change our brain. Using MRI scans, researchers have confirmed that reading activates different parts of the brain, involves a complex brain network and makes the internal network gets connected stronger.

Here are something I've experienced from reading so far:

1. Become More Open-Minded 
2. Bring Tranquility
3. Reduce Stress
4. Improve Sleeping
5. Maintain a Positive Attitude
6. Take Responsibility
7. Improve Communication Skills
8. Become More Grateful and Understanding
9. Show Respect And Love For All Living Things
10. Reshape Personal Attitude Toward Life
11. Inspire More Curiosity
